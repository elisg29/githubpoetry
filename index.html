<h1>Eating gummy rings and thinking about You</h1>
<p>Why do I visualize gross things when I'm eating gummy rings?  </p>
<p>One million circles in front of my eyes.</p>  
<p>I can stop anytime I want.  </p> 
<p>You couldn't stop me if you tried.   </p> 
  
Are gummy rings bad for You?  
What happens when I have too much?  
Am I bad for You?  
What happens when it isn't enough?  
  
Where did You put your wings?  
I'll just have to make do.  
Why am I so addicted to gummy rings?  
I think I just love You.
