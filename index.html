<h1>Eating gummy rings and thinking about You</h1>
<p>Why do I visualize gross things when I'm eating gummy rings?  </p>
<p>One million circles in front of my eyes.</p>  
<p>I can stop anytime I want.  </p> 
<p>You couldn't stop me if you tried.   </p>

<p>Are gummy rings bad for You?  </p> 
<p>What happens when I have too much?  </p> 
<p>Am I bad for You?  </p> 
<p>What happens when it isn't enough?  </p>

<p>Where did You put your wings?  </p> 
<p>I'll just have to make do.  </p> 
<p>Why am I so addicted to gummy rings?  </p> 
<p>I think I just love You.  </p>
